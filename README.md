My Github account is my personal account named scabs00 which is the initial of my first name combined with the first 3 letters of my last name with the year I was born. 
The repository I created is connected to my hard drive where I can edit offline, in a sense, and then push to the actual main branch if needed to
First I logged into my account on the Github Desktop application, clicked on clone a repository to my hard drive and it created a repository on my hard drive under applications.
